# Credit Risk Scoring EDA and MVP Model

> **Note:** This is a prototype and not the actual code used in production.

This repository contains an **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and a **Minimum Viable Product (MVP) Model** for credit risk scoring. It evaluates various machine learning models to assess credit risk and predict loan outcomes.

## 📌 Features Overview
The dataset includes key features related to an applicant’s financial profile, loan details, and creditworthiness:

- **`person_age`**: Applicant's age.
- **`person_income`**: Annual income.
- **`person_home_ownership`**: Home ownership type (`rent`, `mortgage`, `own`, `other`).
- **`person_emp_length`**: Employment length in years.
- **`loan_intent`**: Purpose of the loan.
- **`loan_grade`**: Creditworthiness grade (`A` - `D`).
- **`loan_amnt`**: Loan amount requested.
- **`loan_int_rate`**: Interest rate on the loan.
- **`cb_person_default_on_file`**: History of loan default (`Y` or `N`).
- **`cb_person_cred_score`**: Credit score of the applicant.

## 🏗️ Project Structure
The project consists of **three Jupyter Notebooks**:

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** – Initial data cleaning, visualization, and feature understanding.
2. **Model Development** – Implementation of machine learning models like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, CatBoost, and Neural Networks.
3. **Model Evaluation** – Performance benchmarking and comparison of different models.
